This project focuses on implementing scene graphs, skyboxes, and Bezier Curves.
I used OpenGL to create a scene graph engine in which I could create instances
of a robot model. I animated a 5 x 5 grid of these instances to march along a
Bezier Curve made up of 5 independent Bezier Curves which were approximated with
150 straight line segments each.
